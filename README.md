# MultiHorizon
A program to launch Horizon Zero Dawn with multiple users

I have family members playing Horizon Zero Dawn on my computer, and it was a hassle to switch out save files when other people wanted to play, 
so this is a simple program to swap out the save files and start the game with a stupid simple TUI.

Supports unlimited save files, creating new save files on the fly and mouse controls

Make sure to turn off cloud saves in the Steam game properties, or there will be dragons!

### I am not responsible for loss of save data, use at your own risk and practice good backup habits.
